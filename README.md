**showoci_cloudshell** automates the process of downloading and installing [showoci](https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk/tree/master/examples/showoci) on your [OCI Cloud Shell](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm) session and adds some handy helper tools.

- a shell script to generate a global extract tailored for execution on OCI Cloud Shell
- a ready to view XLSX file, merging each CSV files generated by showoci
- archives of CSV and JSON files generated on the last run

## Installation

Just run the command below on your Cloud Shell session. This is the fastest and simplest way to get access to `showoci` and its helper tools on OCI Cloud Shell.

``` shell
curl -L --silent https://raw.github.com/kral2/showoci_cloudshell/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

It will download the latest version of `showoci` and its helper tools in the current user's home directory. No sudo rights required, tailored for OCI Cloud Shell limited administrative rights.

## Run a report

Launch the reporting script and provide a label for your extract (e.g: the tenant name. You can provide any string).

``` shell
cd showoci_cloudshell
./showoci_report_to_xlsx.sh mytenant
```

> **NOTE**
>
> The report can take up to 15 minutes ... ìt depends on the number of objects deployed on your tenancy. ìn that case, the Cloud Shell session may disconnect because of inactivity: stay close to your keyboard and give it some keystrokes to avoid that.
>
> `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

There will be:

- an excel file will the collected data loaded from the CSV files

- an archive containing all the json files
